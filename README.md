This project utilized paper tessalations in order to take advantage of natural movement that this provides the paper. Mulberry paper has been used for centuries to diffuse light in a natural feeling way and combined with natural movement we hoped to breathe life into the paper.

Inspired by Croatian artist [Goran Konjevod](https://organicorigami.com/), a sculptor with a background in mathematics and theoretical computer science, who explores the tension of paper through abstract shapes and folding techniques.
