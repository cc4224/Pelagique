**What if marine organisms were gifted with a sense of percipience?**

Recent research has shown that certain plants exhibit a form of sensory perception. For example, fungi and mushrooms have been observed to respond to their surroundings, with many researchers suggesting that these responses reflect a form of ‘plant-animal interaction,’ subtly bridging the behaviors of plants and animals.

Inspired by these findings and the biological movements of deep-sea organisms like corals and seagrasses, we aim to synthesize these natural patterns into a new, unified expression of life. By animating this movement, we imbue these organisms with a sense of percipience, inviting audiences into an immersive encounter. This interaction allows viewers to engage directly with these marine-inspired forms, feeling their vibrancy and experiencing a profound connection to the essence of life itself.

As philosopher and naturalist John Muir once said, 'When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.' Through this project, we seek to celebrate the interconnectedness of all living things, inviting people to reflect on the subtleties of life’s movements and the often unseen interactions that weave together our natural world.

This project utilized paper tessalations in order to take advantage of natural movement that this provides the paper. Mulberry paper has been used for centuries to diffuse light in a natural feeling way and combined with natural movement we hoped to breathe life into the paper.

Inspired by Croatian artist [Goran Konjevod](https://organicorigami.com/), a sculptor with a background in mathematics and theoretical computer science, who explores the tension of paper through abstract shapes and folding techniques.
